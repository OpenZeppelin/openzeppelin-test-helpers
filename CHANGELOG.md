# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (2019-03-19)
 * `chai` is no longer exported nor setup. Users should install (and `require`) `chai` on their own, and initialize `chai/should` if they intend to use it. `chai-bn` is however already configured, and does not need to be installed manually. ([#18](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-test-helpers/pull/18))
