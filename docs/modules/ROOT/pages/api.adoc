= API Reference

This documentation is a work in progress: if in doubt, head over to the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-test-helpers/tree/master/test/src[tests directory] to see examples of how each helper can be used.

All returned numbers are of type https://github.com/indutny/bn.js[`BN`].

[[balance]]
== `balance`

Helpers to inspect Ether balances of a specific account.

All of these functions return `BN` instances, with balances in 'wei' by default.

=== `current`

```javascript
async function balance.current(account, unit = 'wei')
```

Returns the current balance of an account.

```javascript
const balance = await balance.current(account)
// same as new BN(web3.eth.getBalance(account))

const balanceEth = await balance.current(account, 'ether')
// same as new BN(web3.utils.fromWei(await web3.eth.getBalance(account), 'ether'))
```

=== `tracker`

```javascript
async function balance.tracker(account, unit = 'wei')
```

Creates an instance of a balance tracker, which lets you keep track of the changes in an account's Ether balance.

```javascript
const tracker = await balance.tracker(account)
```

==== `get`

```javascript
async function tracker.get(unit = tracker.unit)
```

Returns the current balance of an account.

```javascript
const tracker = await balance.tracker(account) // instantiation
const currentBalance = await tracker.get() // returns the current balance of account
```

==== `delta`

```javascript
async function tracker.delta(unit = tracker.unit)
```

Returns the change in the balance since the last time it was checked (with either `get()` or `delta()`).

```javascript
const tracker = await balance.tracker(receiver, 'ether')
send.ether(sender, receiver, ether('10'))
(await tracker.delta()).should.be.bignumber.equal('10');
(await tracker.delta()).should.be.bignumber.equal('0');
```

Or using `get()`:

```javascript
const tracker = await balance.tracker(account) // instantiation
const currentBalance = await tracker.get() // returns the current balance of account
(await tracker.delta()).should.be.bignumber.equal('0');
```

A tracker can also return all balances and deltas in a specific unit:

```javascript
const tracker = await balance.tracker(account, 'gwei');
const balanceGwei = tracker.get(); // in gigawei
const balanceEther = tracker.get('ether'); // in ether
```

[[bn]]
== `BN`

A https://github.com/indutny/bn.js[bn.js] object. Use `new BN(number)` to create `BN` instances.

[[constants]]
== `constants`

A collection of useful constants.

=== `ZERO_ADDRESS`

The initial value of an `address` type variable, i.e., `address(0)` in Solidity.

=== `ZERO_BYTES32`

The initial value of a `bytes32` type variable, i.e., `bytes32(0x00)` in Solidity.

=== `MAX_UINT256`

The maximum unsigned integer `2\^256 - 1` represented in `BN`.

=== `MAX_INT256`

The maximum signed integer `2\^255 - 1` represented in `BN`.

=== `MIN_INT256`

The minimum signed integer `-2\^255` represented in `BN`.

[[ether]]
== `ether`

Converts a value in Ether to wei.

[[expect-event]]
== `expectEvent`

```javascript
function expectEvent(receipt, eventName, eventArgs = {})
```

Asserts that the logs in `receipt` contain an event with name `eventName` and arguments that match those specified in `eventArgs`. `receipt` should be an object returned by either a web3 Contract or a truffle-contract call.

```javascript
const web3Receipt = await MyWeb3Contract.methods.foo('bar').send();
expectEvent(web3Receipt, 'Foo', { value: 'bar' });

const truffleReceipt = await MyTruffleContract.foo('bar');
expectEvent(truffleReceipt, 'Foo', { value: 'bar' });
```

Note that it's possible to leave some or all event arguments unspecified: `expectEvent` will only check the arguments that are provided and ignore the rest.

```javascript
const receipt = await MyWeb3Contract.methods.foo('bar').send();

// Both of these assertions will pass
expectEvent(receipt, 'Foo', { value: 'bar' });
expectEvent(receipt, 'Foo');
```

=== `inTransaction`

```javascript
async function expectEvent.inTransaction(txHash, emitter, eventName, eventArgs = {})
```

Same as `expectEvent`, but for events emitted in an arbitrary transaction (of hash `txHash`), by an arbitrary contract (`emitter`, the contract instance), even if it was indirectly called (i.e. if it was called by another smart contract and not an externally owned account).

```javascript
// With web3 contracts
const contract = await MyContract.deploy().send();
const { transactionHash } = await contract.methods.foo('bar').send();
await expectEvent.inTransaction(transactionHash, contract, 'Foo', { value: 'bar' });

// With truffle contracts
const contract = await MyContract.new();
const { txHash } = await contract.foo('bar');
await expectEvent.inTransaction(txHash, contract, 'Foo', { value: 'bar' });
```

=== `inConstruction`

```javascript
async function expectEvent.inConstruction(emitter, eventName, eventArgs = {})
```

Same as `inTransaction`, but for events emitted during the construction of `emitter`. Note that this is currently only supported for truffle contracts.

[[expect-revert]]
== `expectRevert`

```javascript
async function expectRevert(promise, message)
```

Helpers for transaction failure (similar to https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/#method_throw[chai's `throw`]): asserts that `promise` was rejected due to a reverted transaction.

It will also check that the revert reason includes `message`. Use `expectRevert.unspecified` when the revert reason is unknown.

For example, given the following contract:

[source,solidity]
```
contract Owned {
    address private _owner;

    constructor () {
        _owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function doOwnerOperation() public view {
        require(msg.sender == _owner, "Unauthorized");
        ....
    }
}
```

The `require` statement in the `doOwnerOperation` function can be tested as follows:

```javascript
const { expectRevert } = require('@openzeppelin/test-helpers');

const Owned = artifacts.require('Owned');

contract('Owned', ([owner, other]) => {
  beforeEach(async function () {
    this.owned = Owned.new();
  });

  describe('doOwnerOperation', function() {
    it('Fails when called by a non-owner account', async function () {
      await expectRevert(
        this.owned.doOwnerOperation({ from: other }),
        "Unauthorized"
      );
    });
  });
  ...
```

=== `unspecified`

```javascript
async function expectRevert.unspecified(promise)
```

Like `expectRevert`, asserts that `promise` was rejected due to a reverted transaction caused by a `require` or `revert` statement, but doesn't check the revert reason.

=== `assertion`

```javascript
async function expectRevert.assertion(promise)
```

Asserts that `promise` was rejected due to a reverted transaction caused by an `assert` statement or an invalid opcode.

=== `outOfGas`

```javascript
async function expectRevert.outOfGas(promise)
```

Asserts that `promise` was rejected due to a transaction running out of gas.

[[make-interface-id]]
== `makeInterfaceId`

=== `ERC165`

```javascript
function makeInterfaceId.ERC165(interfaces = [])
```

Calculates the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC165] interface ID of a contract, given a series of function signatures.

=== `ERC1820`

```javascript
function makeInterfaceId.ERC1820(name)
```

Calculates the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC1820] interface hash of a contract, given its name.

[[send]]
== `send`

=== `ether`

```javascript
async function send.ether(from, to, value)
```

Sends `value` Ether from `from` to `to`.

=== `transaction`

```javascript
async function send.transaction(target, name, argsTypes, argsValues, opts = {})
```

Sends a transaction to contract `target`, calling method `name` with `argValues`, which are of type `argTypes` (as per the method's signature).

[[singletons]]
== `singletons`

=== `ERC1820Registry`

```javascript
async function singletons.ERC1820Registry(funder)
```

Returns an instance of an https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC1820Registry] deployed as per the specification (i.e. the registry is located at the canonical address). This can be called multiple times to retrieve the same instance.

[[time]]
== `time`

=== `advanceBlock`

```javascript
async function time.advanceBlock()
```

Forces a block to be mined, incrementing the block height.

=== `advanceBlockTo`

```javascript
async function time.advanceBlockTo(target)
```

Forces blocks to be mined until the the target block height is reached.

Note: Using this function to advance too many blocks can really slow down your tests. Keep its use to a minimum.

=== `latest`

```javascript
async function time.latest()
```

Returns the timestamp of the latest mined block. Should be coupled with `advanceBlock` to retrieve the current blockchain time.

=== `latestBlock`

```javascript
async function time.latestBlock()
```

Returns the latest mined block number.

=== `increase`

```javascript
async function time.increase(duration)
```

Increases the time of the blockchain by link:#timeduration[`duration`] (in seconds), and mines a new block with that timestamp.

=== `increaseTo`

```javascript
async function time.increaseTo(target)
```

Same as `increase`, but a target time is specified instead of a duration.

=== `duration`

```javascript
function time.duration()
```

Helpers to convert different time units to seconds. Available helpers are: `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks` and `years`.

```javascript
await time.increase(time.duration.years(2));
```
